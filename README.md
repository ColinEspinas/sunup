# sunup
A zero dependency, web component based front-end framework written in plain ES modules.

**This project is part of a challenge I made for myself, I wanted to build a modern fullstack framework for my personal projects.**

[Sunup](https://github.com/ColinEspinas/sunup) is the front-end and [Moonset](https://github.com/ColinEspinas/moonset) is the back-end. Together they bring all the functionalities you need to build a modern website/application.
